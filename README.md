In addition to the previous git notations, "git add <file>" must be done first.

During Simon, I continued to learn the power of git as I at one point replaced my index.html file (that previously had about me info) with the index.html from simon. I was able to backtrack and fix my mistake without git, but the assurance that git had the file the whole time reassured me.

Also during Simon, I loved using one VS Code window to make my file edits for git and deployment while having another VS Code window to check the files on my server. Additionally, the quick and easy deployment made for fast checking of versions and adjustments when I messed things up.
